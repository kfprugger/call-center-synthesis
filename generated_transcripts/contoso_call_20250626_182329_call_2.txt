==================================================

Agent: Good morning, Contoso Medical, this is Stephen. How may I assist you?
Michelle Anderson: Hi, I'm calling about my recent visit to Contoso Specialty Center on 06/22/2025.
Agent: Hello, Michelle Anderson. I'd be happy to help you with questions about your visit. Can you verify your date of birth for me?
Michelle Anderson: Yes, it's 10/08/1997.
Agent: Thank you. I have your record here. What questions do you have about your visit?
Michelle Anderson: I'm very upset about my experience. I waited over three hours to be seen.
Agent: I'm so sorry to hear about the long wait time. That's definitely not the experience we want for our patients.
Michelle Anderson: And then the doctor seemed rushed and didn't explain my Hypothyroidism properly.
Agent: I sincerely apologize. Let me connect you with our patient advocate to address these concerns.
Michelle Anderson: I also received a bill that seems incorrect. The charges don't match what I was told.
Agent: I understand your frustration. I'm going to have both our billing department and patient advocate reach out to you today.
Michelle Anderson: This whole experience has been disappointing. I expected better from Contoso Medical.
Agent: You have every right to be upset, and we're going to make this right. You'll hear from us within 24 hours.
