==================================================

Agent: Contoso Medical, this is Cassandra. How can I help you today?
Anita Sanders: Hello, I'm calling about my mother, Brittany Jordan. I'm their primary caregiver.
Agent: Hi Anita Sanders. I'd be happy to help. For privacy purposes, I'll need to verify that you're authorized to discuss this patient's information.
Anita Sanders: Yes, I should be listed as an authorized contact. My name is Anita Sanders.
Agent: Thank you. I can confirm you're listed as an authorized caregiver. What questions do you have?
Anita Sanders: I'm very concerned about Brittany Jordan's condition. They seem to be getting worse, not better.
Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what changes you've noticed?
Anita Sanders: The medication doesn't seem to be helping, and they're in more pain than before.
Agent: That's definitely concerning. Let me check when their last appointment was... I think we need to get them seen sooner.
Anita Sanders: I've been trying to reach Dr. Mckee for days but haven't heard back.
Agent: That's unacceptable. I'm going to escalate this immediately and have the doctor call you today.
Anita Sanders: Brittany Jordan is suffering, and I feel like no one is listening to our concerns.
Agent: I hear you, and I'm going to make sure this gets the urgent attention it deserves. You'll hear from us within two hours.
